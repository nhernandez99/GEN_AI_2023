# GenerativeAI 2023

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Welcome to my GitHub repository covering generative AI related work! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of code examples, tutorials, and resources related to various generative AI models such as GANs, VAEs, and style transfer. The focus will be on using Python and PyTorch to implement and train these models, and also on exploring the intersection between generative AI and natural language processing through models such as CLIP. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository is meant to be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the exciting world of generative AI.
